Hi, my name is Arjun Attam. 👋

![Arjun Attam](/images/arjun.jpg)

**Inter Alia**—or among other things—is my personal space to explore topics that catch my fancy: technology, books, internet businesses, and economics.

I build **developer tools**: specifically to help developers collaborate over their code. With teams going remote and product dev cycles becoming leaner, I feel gains in developer collaboration significantly enhance engineering output. You can find my work at:

* [Rubberduck](https://www.rubberduck.io): a browser extension to speed up code reviews on GitHub.
* [Team Chat](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat): an editor extension for easier, contextual collaboration for developers.

Previously, I have worked as a freelance product manager, customer success lead, software developer, and management consultant. A quick web search will give you more details if that interests you.

I'm [@arjunattam](https://twitter.com/arjunattam/) on Twitter and my DMs are open for conversations.
