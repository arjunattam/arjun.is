Hi, my name is Arjun Attam.

![Arjun Attam]({{site.baseurl}}/arjun.jpg){: .align-left}

Inter Alia—or among other things—is my personal space to explore topics that catch my fancy: technology, books, internet businesses, and economics.

Currently, I am working on developer tools: specifically on how developers collaborate over code: in times when teams are remote, and product dev cycles are lean. Check out [Rubberduck](https://www.rubberduck.io): a browser extension to speed up code reviews on GitHub, and [Team Chat](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat): an editor extension for easier, contextual collaboration for developers.

Previously, I have worked as a freelance product manager, customer success lead, software developer, and management consultant. A quick web search should give you more details if that interests you.

I'm as [@arjunattam](https://twitter.com/arjunattam/) on Twitter and my DMs are open for conversations.
