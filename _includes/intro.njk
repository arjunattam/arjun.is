<p>Hi, I'm Arjun. ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>
  I work at <a href="https://100ms.live">100ms</a>, where we build infrastructure
  for live, interactive video. I believe video on the Internet is an incredible
  equaliser for opportunity: it brings us together to learn from each
  other and achieve common goals. We enable developers to build live video features
  in their apps.

<p>
  I love building products for developers. As every company becomes a tech
  company, developers have a unique opportunity to create value for their
  users. Empowering developers to do more drives me to work everyday. I've previously built
  products for developers across startups and big tech (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunattam/">my LinkedIn</a>).

  Iâ€™m a builder and engineer at heart. I've built side-projects like <a href="https://github.com/covid-maps/covid-maps">Covid Maps</a>
  (featured on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/grocery-pharmacy-stores-open-india-lockdown/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://yourstory.com/2020/04/coronavirus-techies-startups-collaboration-delivery-essentials">YourStory</a> and <a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/video/2020/04/02/web-based-app-provides-map-of-essentials/">CityNews</a>), <a href="https://www.rubberduck.io">Rubberduck</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat">VS Code Chat</a>.
  I also hosted <a href="https://startupgreenroom.com">the Startup Green Room</a> podcast to
  showcase the best operators in the Indian startup ecosystem.
