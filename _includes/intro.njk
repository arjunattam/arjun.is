<p>Hi, I'm Arjun. 👋</p>
<p>
  I'm building <a href="https://empirical.run">empirical.run</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I love building products for developers. As software “eats the world”,
  I believe developers have an opportunity to create immense value—and
  empowering them to do more drives me to work everyday. I've been lucky
  to do this as a day job for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunattam/">many years</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I've built some side-projects too, like <a href="https://github.com/covid-maps/covid-maps">Covid Maps</a>
  (featured on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/grocery-pharmacy-stores-open-india-lockdown/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://yourstory.com/2020/04/coronavirus-techies-startups-collaboration-delivery-essentials">YourStory</a> and <a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/video/2020/04/02/web-based-app-provides-map-of-essentials/">CityNews</a>), <a href="https://www.rubberduck.io">Rubberduck</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat">VS Code Chat</a>, and the <a href="https://startupgreenroom.com">Startup Green Room</a> podcast.
