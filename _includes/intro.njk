<p>Hi, I'm Arjun. 👋</p>
<p>
  I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft, where I work on developer tools and 
  services. With every company becoming a software company, I believe making 
  developers productive creates a lot of value, and I enjoy working with them. 
  Before joining Microsoft, I built <a href="https://www.rubberduck.io">Rubberduck</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat">Team Chat</a> to explore
  how developers collaborate, and I'm now applying these learnings at scale.

  Previously, I've worked at HyperTrack and McKinsey &amp; Co.

<p>
  On the side, I host <a href="https://startupgreenroom.com">the Startup Green
  Room</a> podcast, to showcase the best operators in the Indian startup
  ecosystem. I've learnt and grown by building startups in India, and this
  podcast is my way to stay connected and contribute to the ecosystem.
